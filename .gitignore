# Django gitignore #

# NOTE-01: Comments.
#* Lines starting with a hash mark (#) are comments and are ignored. 
#* Empty lines can be used to improve the readability of the file and to group related lines of patterns.

# NOTE-02: Slash.
#* The slash symbol (/) represents a directory separator. 
#** The slash at the beginning of a pattern is relative to the directory where the .gitignore resides.
#** If the pattern starts with a slash, it matches files and directories only in the repository root.
#** If the pattern doesnâ€™t start with a slash, it matches files and directories in any directory or subdirectory.
#** If the pattern ends with a slash, it matches only directories. 
#*** When a directory is ignored, all of its files and subdirectories are also ignored.

# NOTE-03: Using (**).
# In case you need to exclude sub folders you can use the ** wildcard to exclude any level of sub directory.

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
